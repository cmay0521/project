<h4>Design Process</h4>
<p>When designing these visualizations, we wanted to wide range that players in Madden could be rated and to show where most players were rated. We decided it was best to show this not only in rating but also in physical attributes such as height and weight to show the different type of bodies that can be in the NFL to show that there was not a required body size in order to make it. Finally, we wantd to show how teams stacked up against each other and to see if better teams had a higher amount of higher rated players.</p>



<h4>Design Choices</h4>
<p>We used a histogram for the overall rating at each position and for the team becuase we wanted to show exactly how many players were given a certain rating and what the most common rating was at each position, and for the team to show if teams that were considered better had better players</p>
<p>FOr the Height vs Weight graph we decided on a scatter plot because we wanted to see a distribution across the many different players. This allowed us to see that players with varying heights and weights could make the NFL.</p>

<h4>Fact Discoveries</h4>
<p>What we learned is that most players in the NFL were rated around 65-70 overall. Also that wide receivers(WR) had the most amount of players rated above 90. Looking at the height vs weight scatter plot, the majority of NFL players weighed in between 170 and 330 pounds and when it came to height, most players were between 74 and 77 inches tall</p>
